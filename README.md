# Password Generator

## Discription

I can never think of a good password to use for those new password 
inputs.  My mind simply blinks out and I stare aimlessly at the 
screen with a blank face, and imagining the Flintstones hammering 
away at my brain.

I need to stop my drooling face from ruining my laptop.  So I need 
to devise a plan to through these faces from ciruclating into my 
meme gods friends' hands.

Therefore, if I evr want a piece of mind and don't want my stupid 
face to cirulate around them, I must create this password generate.

So with the advent of this divine password generator that 
creates random passwords and passcodes for me.  I can finally, 
laugh maniacally at this genius plan of stopping my friends
from obtaining more embarrassing photos.

## Installation
Yeah to be honest though, I don't know how you would install this.
I am guessing you either got to clone this from my respitory or
go to the website I generate with it to be able to access this.

## Usage
To use this is pretty simple.  You just need to press the generate 
button.  Once you press it, there will be prompts that pops up 
asking you questions for your passwords.  You will need to answer 
them.

They will ask for the password length which needs to be
between 8-128 characters long. And ask whether you would need it 
to be lowercase, uppercase, symbols, and number characters for 
your password. After the prompts the password characters will show 
up in the textarea.

Afterward, you will need to press the copy button. Once clicked, 
it will select the password characters and copy it. Thenn you can 
paste it anywhere you would like.  

## Credit
I would credit this password to Diarmuid Murphy.  He is my 
instrustor for my Web Design Bootcamp.  I used his burrito code 
as my structure to code out this generator.

I also obtain the copy event from

## What-I-would-like-to-try
I would like to change up the code a little and test out:

charAt()
for() loops

for loops because it faster than if statements
chartAt() beacuse I'll be using strings instead of arrays and limit 
the split() and join()
